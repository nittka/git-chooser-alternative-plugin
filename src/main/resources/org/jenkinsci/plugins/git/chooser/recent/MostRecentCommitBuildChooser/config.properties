blurb=From all matching branches to build, choose only the one with the most recent commit. \
  This is useful, for example, if polling should ignore certain commit messages, \
  as branches with such a message would still be built when there is a regular commit on another branch. \
  Similarly, if multiple jobs build from the same repository but listen to different paths, \
  a commit for the correct path will not trigger building branches for other paths that were previously ignored.
